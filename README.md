# toxic-comment-classification

In this project, several NLP techniques and machine learning models were explored to build a model capable of detecting different types of toxicity, using a dataset of comments from Wikipediaâ€™s talk page edits.

## Problem Statement
The problem was taking from the following Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/overview and the dataset consist of a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. 
The types of toxicity are:
